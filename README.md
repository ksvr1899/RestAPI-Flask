# REST APIs with Flask and Python



---

<p align = "center">ðŸ’¡REST APIs using multiple Flask extensions and PostgreSQL.</p>

## This Repository includes all the sections worked on each phases. 

## Section: My first REST API

The code in this section includes a simple Flask app that accepts and returns JSON data.

## Section: Docker

Introduction to Docker to run your REST APIs. We talk about images, containers, and how to run applications.

## Section: Flask-Smorest

We introduce the Flask-Smorest extension, a library that greatly simplifies writing REST APIs using Flask. It also provides things like automated documentation generation.

## Section: Flask-SQLAlchemy

The code in this section extends the previous section by replacing the data storage in Python lists with SQLAlchemy, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping which simplifies connecting to and interacting with a database.

## Section: Many-to-many relationships

In this section we talk about many-to-many relationships using SQLAlchemy.

## Section: Authentication with Flask-JWT-Extended

Learn how to perform user authentication using JWTs and the Flask-JWT-Extended library. Here we talk about access token JWTs, as well as refresh tokens, JWT claims, blocklists, password hashing, and more.

## Section: Flask-Migrate

After deploying your apps, making changes to the database can be really tricky because you have to log in to the database server and manually update the database tables using SQL commands.

Flask-Migrate and the Alembic libraries simplify this job by creating migration scripts.

## Section: Deploying to Render.com

Learn how to get your code running in the cloud and make it publicly accessible. In this section we use Render.com for deployments and we also deploy a PostgreSQL database.
