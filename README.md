---

<p align = "center">ðŸ’¡REST APIs using multiple Flask extensions and PostgreSQL.</p>

## This Repository includes all the sections worked on each phases. 

## Section: My first REST API

The code in this section includes a simple Flask app that accepts and returns JSON data.

## Section: Docker

Introduction to Docker to run my REST APIs using Docker images, containers, and how to run applications.

## Section: Flask-Smorest

Flask-Smorest extension, a library that greatly simplifies writing REST APIs using Flask. It also provides things like automated documentation generation.

## Section: Flask-SQLAlchemy

The code in this section extends the previous section by replacing the data storage in Python lists with SQLAlchemy, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping which simplifies connecting to and interacting with a database.

## Section: Many-to-many relationships

This section covers many-to-many relationships using SQLAlchemy.

## Section: Authentication with Flask-JWT-Extended

This section provides the information about how to perform user authentication using JWTs and the Flask-JWT-Extended library and also about access token JWTs, as well as refresh tokens, JWT claims, blocklists, password hashing, and more.

## Section: Flask-Migrate

After deploying my apps, making changes to the database can be really tricky because you have to log in to the database server and manually update the database tables using SQL commands. That is why we are using flask-Migrate

Flask-Migrate and the Alembic libraries simplify this job by creating migration scripts.

## Section: Deploying to Render.com

Implementation of Render.com to clear that how to get my code running in the cloud and make it publicly accessible. In this section we use Render.com for deployments and we also deploy a PostgreSQL database.
